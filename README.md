# Frequency Mixer and Demixer

This project implements a basic frequency mixer and demixer system using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. Frequency mixers are essential components in modern communication systems, used to shift signals between frequency bands for modulation and demodulation. The demixer component recovers the original baseband signal from the modulated waveform.
